                  <p> If you want to generate a valid SSL certificate with certbot automatically, you can use the
                    following script.
                    But first you need to configure your DNS settings to point to the server where you will run the
                    container.
                    Maybe it would be better to use bridge network or use host network and use the ports 80 and 443
                    directly.

                <h4 class="sub-heading">Step 2 - Confirming Wallet Addition</h4>
                <p>If you want, you can confirm the wallet addition using Filebrowser. To do this, in the Frontend left
                  side
                  menu, choose "Files", enter your username and password to log in:</p>

                <p>When you add a wallet, it will be added to the Hummingbot Gateway and Hummingbot Client files.</p>
                <p>In Hummingbot Gateway, for each wallet added, there will be a .json file in the directory:</p>
                <pre class="code">hummingbot/gateway/conf/wallets/kujira</pre>
                <img src="../../../assets/images/script/gateway_wallet_folder.png" alt="Filebrowser">

                <p>In the Hummingbot Client, when you add a wallet, it will be added to the <strong>mainnet</strong> and
                  <strong>testnet</strong> networks in the <strong>hummingbot/conf/gateway_connections.json</strong>
                  file and
                  due to how the Hummingbot Client works, whenever you add a new wallet to the same chain, this new
                  wallet will
                  replace the wallet that was previously added, so for the Hummingbot Client, each chain can only have
                  one
                  wallet, but for the Hummingbot Gateway, there can be indefinite wallets added.</p>
                <p>Unlike <strong>Hummingbot Client</strong>, <strong>Funttastic Client</strong> will be able to handle
                  all the

              <p>Using Filebrowser through Frontend, access the following directory to access the strategy configuration

              <pre class="code">funttastic/client/resources/strategies/pure_market_making/1.0.0</pre>

                   alt="Workers strategy configuration files">

              <h4 class="sub-heading">Step 3 - Configuring A Worker</h4>
              <p>By default, there are already configuration files for three workers in the <strong>workers</strong>
                folder.</p>
              <p>If you want more workers, just duplicate any of the worker configuration files and change the
                <strong>id</strong> in the settings within the file to an id that is not in use.</p>
              <p>For both the file names and their internally defined ids, you can define whatever name you want, just
                keep the
                <strong>.yml</strong> extension.</p>
              <p>If you don't want to use any of your workers, you don't need to remove their configuration files, just
                disable
                it in the <strong>supervisor</strong> configuration file, as we will see later.</p>
              <p>But if you want to completely delete the configuration file of one of the workers, no problem, you can
                remove
                it. Just make sure to disable his <strong>id</strong> in your <strong>supervisor</strong> settings.</p>
              <p>When you open some <strong>worker</strong> configuration file, you will see something like below:</p>
              <img class="img" src="../../../assets/images/script/worker_configuration_file_template.png"
                   alt="Worker configuration file template">
              <p>In the other image below, there is an example of a configured worker.</p>
              <p>Below the image read some explanations about some defined parameters:</p>
              <img class="img" src="../../../assets/images/script/worker_configuration_example.png"
                   alt="Worker configuration file template">
              <p><strong>Line 1</strong>: <strong>id</strong> - here you must define the <strong>id</strong> of the
                worker. For
                simplicity, a numeric <strong>id</strong> was defined there, but you can define any name you want, just
                avoid
                special characters and spaces.</p>
              <p><strong>Line 2</strong>: <strong>wallet</strong> - here you must add the public key of your wallet.
                This public
                key must be derived from the same <strong>mnemonic</strong> that you used or will use to add your wallet
                through
                <strong>Add Wallet</strong> on the <strong>Home</strong> page of the frontend.</p>
              <p><strong>Line 3</strong>: <strong>market</strong> - here you must define the market in which this worker
                will
                work. In this example, the <strong>KUJI/USK</strong> market was defined. The markets you will be able to
                trade
                on will be the markets available for <strong>mainnet</strong> and <strong>testnet</strong> on
                <strong>Kujira</strong>'s <strong>FIN</strong> at https://fin.kujira.network/. The name pattern normally
                consists of two symbols written in capital letters separated by the symbol <strong>"/"</strong>. If in
                doubt,
                open the market on <strong>FIN</strong> and look at the name of the pair in the page title.</p>

              <p><strong>LAYERS:</strong></p>
              <p>See in the image above that 2 layers were defined. The main reason for allowing the creation of
                multiple layers
                is to define different spread levels for the same worker. You can add as many layers as you want.</p>
              <p>If you want to add more layers, copy another existing layer and paste it below it and then change the
                values.
                If you want to deactivate a layer without deleting it completely, just comment on the layer's lines by
                adding
                the symbol "#" at the beginning of its lines, on the left side.</p>
              <p>Each layer has a "bid" side and an "ask" side. If you want, you can define different quantity, spread,
                and
                budget values between sides.</p>
              <p>Some settings can be made using absolute values or percentage values. Absolute values will prevail over
                percentage values. To understand better, consider for example the spread configuration on the bid side
                of layer
                1 - if you define a value greater than zero for absolute, regardless of the value you define in
                percentage, the
                absolute value that will be considered, so if you want the percentage value to be considered, set the
                absolute
                value to 0 (zero) or null.</p>

              <h4 class="sub-heading">Layer 1 (Line 6 to 21)</h4>
              <p>Summary:</p>
              <p>In this example configuration, layer 1 is saying:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create 3 buy orders, with each order having an amount of 40 (120 / 3 = 40) USK and the prices of the
                  orders
                  must be at a distance of 5% in relation to the market price.
                </li>
                <li>Create 4 sell orders, with each order having an amount of 25 (100 / 4 = 25) KUJI and the prices of
                  the
                  orders must be within a distance of 5% in relation to the market price.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>To understand in detail, look at layer 1 - see that for bid the value 3 was defined for quantity, the
                value 0
                for spread. absolute, the value 5 for spread. percentage, the value 120 for budget. absolute and the
                value 10
                for budget.percentage.</p>
              <p>As explained previously, if the absolute value is greater than zero, it will be considered and the
                percentage
                value will be ignored.</p>

              <p><strong>Bid Side</strong>:</p>
              <p>In spread, as the value 0 was defined for absolute and the value 5 for percentage, it means that the
                spread
                will be a percentage, that is, the orders will have their prices defined with a percentage distance in
                relation
                to the market price, in this example 5%. If a value greater than zero had been set for spread. absolute,
                the
                distance from the market price would be calculated using a fixed value.</p>
              <p>In budget, both for absolute and percentage values greater than zero are defined, but the percentage
                value will
                be ignored, so the budget considered will be 120 tokens USK. If budget. absolute had been set to 0 or
                null, the
                budget would be 10% of the total amount of USK tokens in your portfolio.</p>
              <p>In quantity, the value 3 was defined, so the budget defined for 120 would be divided into 3 parts, so
                each
                purchase order (bid) of layer 1 will have an amount of 40 USK.</p>

              <p><strong>Ask Side</strong>:</p>
              <p>In spread, the settings are identical to what was configured for the bid side, so the explanation is
                the
                same.</p>
              <p>In budget, the explanation is almost the same as the explanation given for the bid side, the difference
                is the
                amount. Now there are 100 USK tokens that will be divided by the number of orders that will be
                created.</p>
              <p>In quantity, the value 4 was defined, so the budget defined for 100 would be divided into 4 parts, so
                each sell
                order (ask) of layer 1 will have an amount of 25 USK.</p>

              <h4 class="sub-heading">Layer 2 (Line 22 to 37)</h4>
              <p>Summary:</p>
              <p>In this example configuration, layer 2 is saying:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Allocate 25% of the portfolio's total free USK and divide this allocated amount into 8 equal parts
                  (orders)
                  and the prices of the orders must be at a distance of 10% in relation to the market price.
                </li>
                <li>Allocate 25% of the total free KUJI in the portfolio and divide this allocated amount into 3 equal
                  parts
                  (orders) and the prices of the orders must be at a distance of 10% in relation to the market price.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>To understand in detail, look at layer 2 - See that for bid the value 8 was defined for quantity, the
                value 0
                for spread. absolute, the value 10 for spread. percentage, the value 0 for budget. absolute and the
                value 25 for
                budget.percentage. Also see that for ask the value 3 was defined for quantity, the value 0 for spread.
                absolute,
                the value 10 for spread. percentage, the value 0 for budget. absolute and the value 25 for
                budget.percentage.</p>
              <p>As explained previously, if the absolute value is greater than zero, it will be considered and the
                percentage
                value will be ignored.</p>

              <p><strong>Bid Side</strong>:</p>
              <p>In spread, as the value 0 was defined for absolute and the value 10 for percentage, it means that the
                spread
                will be a percentage, that is, the orders will have their prices defined with a percentage distance in
                relation
                to the market price, in this example 10%. If a value greater than zero had been set for spread.
                absolute, the
                distance from the market price would have been calculated using a fixed value.</p>
              <p>In budget, as the value 0 was defined for absolute and the value 25 for percentage, it means that the
                budget
                will be a percentage in relation the free amount of USK available in the portfolio, so in this example
                25% will
                be allocated. If the free amount available in the portfolio is 1280 USK, then the allocated amount will
                be 320
                USK.</p>
              <p>In quantity, the value 8 was defined, so if the percentage value allocated to the budget is equivalent
                to 320
                USK, then each buy order (bid) of the layer 2 will have an amount of 40 USK.</p>

              <p><strong>Ask Side</strong>:</p>
              <p>In spread, the settings are identical to what was configured for the bid side, so the explanation is
                the
                same.</p>
              <p>In budget, the settings are also identical to what was configured for the bid side, so the explanation
                is
                similar.</p>
              <p>In quantity, the value 3 was defined, so if the percentage value allocated to the budget is equivalent
                to 180
                KUJI, then each sell order (ask) of the layer 2 will have an amount of 60 KUJI.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 38</strong>: <strong>tick_interval</strong> - Here you must define an integer number of
                seconds
                that the script must wait before starting the next cycle. Each strategy performs a routine every cycle,
                such as
                replacing old orders with new ones with different prices or other things. If you set the number too
                small,
                cycles will be faster and more intense, which could increase your fee costs in some cases.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 39</strong>: <strong>order_type</strong> - Here you can define whether market orders or
                limit
                orders will be created. You can set LIMIT or MARKET values. Limit orders are the type of order where you
                can set
                the price you are willing to buy and sell, they may not be executed immediately. For market orders, you
                cannot
                define the sell price or buy price, only the amount, but they are executed immediately - if it is a buy
                order,
                your tokens will be purchased at the lowest price available on the market at that time and if it is a
                sell
                order, your tokens will be sold for the highest price anyone is willing to pay at that time.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 42</strong>: <strong>cancel_all_orders_on_start</strong> - If true, when the strategy is

                all orders that are open in the market defined for that owner will be cancelled.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 43</strong>: <strong>withdraw_market_on_start</strong> - If true, when the strategy is
                started,
                all orders that have been filled will have their tokens sent to the free balance of the wallet. If an
                order has
                been partially filled, only the filled portion will be moved to the free balance and the amount still
                stuck in
                the open portion will not be affected.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 44</strong>: <strong>withdraw_market_on_tick</strong> - As you saw above when
                tick_interval was
                explained, the script runs cycles continuously, so if this parameter is set to true, the balances of
                filled
                orders will be moved to the free balance of the wallet every cycle. This is useful to ensure that the
                portfolio
                does not run out of free balance, which could compromise the functionality of the strategy.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 45</strong>: <strong>cancel_all_orders_on_stop</strong> - If true, when the user sends the

                cancelled.</p>

                free
                balance of the wallet.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 47</strong>: <strong>sleep_time_after_withdraw</strong> - Time in seconds that the script
                must
                wait before starting the next task after making the withdrawals. This may be necessary due to the time
                the
                blockchain may take to update the free balance in the wallet. Having accurate free or blocked balance
                information is very important for the strategy to work well.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 48</strong>: <strong>sleep_time_after_orders_creation</strong> - Time in seconds that the
                script
                must wait before starting the next task after creating new orders. The reason is the same as written
                above.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 49</strong>: <strong>sleep_time_after_orders_cancellation</strong> - Time in seconds that
                the

                same as
                written above.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 50 to 62</strong>: <strong>minimize_fees_cost</strong> - If true, the algorithm will check
                whether
                orders that are already open should be replaced or not or whether new orders should be created,
                considering
                tolerance values within which order parameters, such as price, may vary and may still be considered
                appropriate
                for market conditions. This feature is useful for reducing creation, cancellation, and withdrawal fees,
                especially when the market is very volatile.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 63</strong>: <strong>be_the_first</strong> - If true, this worker will always try to place
                orders
                at the best market prices, that is, when it is a sell order, it will place a slightly lower price than
                the
                lowest market price and when it is a buy order, it will place a slightly higher price than the highest
                price
                someone is willing to pay in this market.</p>

              <p><strong>Line 64</strong>: <strong>run_only_once</strong> - If true, this worker will only run one full

              <ul>
                <li><strong>max_wallet_loss_from_initial_value</strong> - the percentage value that the wallet can lose
                  in
                  relation to the total value that was recorded when the worker was started.
                </li>
                <li><strong>max_wallet_loss_from_previous_value</strong> - the percentage value that the wallet can lose
                  in
                  relation to the total value that was recorded in the previous cycle. This kill switch is useful for
                  when the
                  market is very volatile and can have large variations in a short period of time.
                </li>

                  the wallet
                  can have considering the quotient between the total PnL of the wallet from the beginning and the PnL
                  of the
                  base token value from the beginning. This is useful for when the market has low volatility, but
                  generates
                  losses over time that may not activate the other kill switches.
                </li>
                <li><strong>max_token_loss_from_initial</strong> - the percentage value that the base token price can
                  lose in
                  relation to the value it had when the worker was started. This is useful to prevent your tokens from
                  being
                  sold at very low prices, so you can trade them later when the token value rises again.
                </li>
                <li><strong>admin.telegram.users</strong> - this is an array in which you can specify which users of the

              <h4 class="sub-heading">Extra Step - New Configuration Files From Template</h4>
              <p>During the installation process, the folders with the strategy configuration files are automatically
                copied

              <pre class="code">funttastic/client/resources/strategies</pre>
              <p>These copied configuration files will be read by the application. But if you want to create new
                configurations
                completely clean, you can copy the folder of the desired strategy inside the <strong>templates</strong>
                folder
                and paste it next to the <strong>templates</strong> folder itself, similar to the
